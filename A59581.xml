            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not from too tender indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to mine own Conceptions, that I have given this enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this publick Birth, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to immortalize it by dedicating it to your Name: but taking a juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my Obligations by your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I eaſily diſcerned, that my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgments ought to be as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and manifeſt, as They have been notoriouſly free and bountiful; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

Whether this refer to a greater proportion of Gifts in the ſame kind, or to an addition of Gifts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind and of greater worth and excellency than the former improved ones, is a matter of doubt with ſome: but it ſeems-plain to me by the purport of the Parable, that a variety of more choice and excellent gifts rather than a plenty in the ſame kind is here meant. for the expreſſion <hi>[Shall be given in all abundance]</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the advantagious ſentence paſſed on the behalf of the good and faithful Servant, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how juſt it was upon the improvement of his Five Talents, that he ſhould obtain ſuch acceptation and ſucceſs as he did; that is, that he ſhould be judged meetly qualifyed <hi>to enter into his Maſters joy,</hi> and the wicked and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants loſs ſhould be His gaine. And that which makes it moſt evident is this, as the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unprofitable Servant into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, is an Emblem and repreſentation of helliſh damnation and deſtruction (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed divers times in the ſame words) <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12.22.13.24.51. and denotes the great

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36131:9"/>ſtrong, many or few, he ſhall not only better his ſay'd eſtate of abilities and Gifts, but is alſo in a ready way to receive abilities and Gifts of a nobler nature and higher concerne. The drift of our Saviour in this and the former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which begins the Chapter, is to provoke us to Watchfulneſs and Diligence in our duties, that we may be prepared for the coming of our Lord to judgment. And the argument urged in the Text ſhews the neceſſity of this Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and diligence in order to our ſtanding in judgment before him, and that we may be accounted worthy to eſcape the puniſhment which ſhall be inflicted on the careleſs and ſlothful, from the rule and order which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his diſtribution of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.

               <p>

I think 'tis eaſily diſcerned, that the Talents were not in their immediate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and appropriate qualities, of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and ſaving import: for the Parable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the ſtate of Mankind in general, and ſhews how it is eventually both with good and bad; and 'tis expreſsly ſaid of him which had the one Talent, that he was <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> whilſt he had the Talent, a wicked and ſlothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and therefore theſe Talents had not a neceſſary conjunction with an heavenly condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſaving conſequence. And if it ſhould be granted that theſe Talents were in their proper and immediate natures regenerating and ſanctifying graces, then it will unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, that regenerating and ſanctifying grace may be totally and finally loſt, which ſome men will by no means believe to be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What is premiſed ſeems to me a ſufficient inducement to conclude, that the Talents were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36131:10"/>in themſelves of indifferent Nature; not things abſolutely good, but things of good or bad abode, as they were uſed by them which had them. Yet be pleaſed to obſerve, as the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improvement of the Talent was an equitable conſideration on which to exerciſe an act of vindictive Juſtice, ſo the improvement thereof would have been an equitable conſideration on which to exerciſe an act of remunerating Grace. I do not mean, that the improvement would deſerve <hi>ex condigno,</hi> a reward of grace as the non-improvement did deſerve a reward (if I may ſo ſay) of puniſhment; but that the improvement by the juſt ordination of God (who will have mercy upon whom and upon what terms he pleaſeth) would have had even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually a gracious acceptation and a bountiful reward, as the non-improvement heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and puniſhment. For as he which hid his Talent was ſeverely puniſhed, ſo they which improved their Talents were bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed. From whence we may very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally infer, That God is propitious to our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavours, and doth ſo bleſs us with the preſence of his grace when we lay out our power to our utmoſt to ſerve him in our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings, that he will derive to us the moſt inriching Gifts and Graces.</p>

I confeſs I think the habits and acts of moral Vertues and ſome common Graces to be materially the ſame with the habits and acts of Spiritual and Evangelical Graces, and to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only as the leſs perfect from the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but yet I take them to be ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. For ſuch is the Nature of theſe things, that a gradual perfection conſtituteth a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical difference. As in <hi>Numbers,</hi> a variation of Degrees alters the ſpecies and makes one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber formally diſtinct from another. <hi>e. g.</hi> the number Ten differs only by the addition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the number Five, and yet Ten is not only individually but ſpecifically a diſtinct number from Five. And though Nine be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically diſtinct from Ten as well as Five, yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36131:17"/>Nine is nearer and may more eaſily be brought up to Ten, than Five can. So though moral Vertues and common Graces are things of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctint Kind and Nature from Divine and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Graces, yet they have more alliance and ſympathy with evangelical Graces than habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vices have. 'Tis true, he which is in the Church-yard is formally and indeed out of this Congregation as well as he which is diſtant from it a thouſand miles; yet the one is nearer and may more eaſily come into this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the other can: ſo a moral man and one endowed with common Graces, I mean, a man which doth follow the conduct of Reaſon ſo far and as much as an unregenerate man can do, in ſhunning the Vices his Reaſon condemns, and in practiſing the Vertues his Reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, which hath an honeſt integrity of heart as <hi>Abimeleck</hi> had <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. and keepeth all the known commandements of God, as the young man which came to Chriſt had done, (<hi>Matt.</hi> 19, 20.) which feareth God, worketh Righteouſneſs, and giveth Alms to the Poor as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, (<hi>Act.</hi> 10, 37.) and hath a Zeal for the worſhip of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 2.) and intends well as to lower inferiour ends, as <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion did, (<hi>Act.</hi> 23.1.26, 5.) I ſay, though ſuch an one be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and in truth out of the Kingdom of God, as well as the man debauched with Vice, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36131:18"/>diſtracted with the perturbation of his Paſſions, and Luſts, yet he is not ſo far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God as the other is: (<hi>Mark</hi> 12, 34.) he hath not ſo much to do; ſo many hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to remove, and ſo many inducements to gain, ſo much preparation to make, ſo many degrees of enmity againſt God and Religion to abate, and ſo many ſteps towards a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reformation to take, as a lewd Ruffian hath. I know that God is able of Stones to raiſe up Children to <hi>Abraham:</hi> but I know alſo that God will not do all that he is able to do; for God doth not adminiſter and manage the affairs of his heavenly Kingdom as a Phyſical Agent in a way of Natural power, but as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, by a Rectoral Power, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how things ſhall be effected according to the Council of his own Will; and 'tis the Will of God as affected and inclined by potent Conſiderations, and congruous motives ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him by his Wiſdom and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which directs and draws forth his Power into Action, when he regenerates a man. And though he may in ſome extraordinary caſes now and then occurring, to ſubſerve his own Glory and the general good of Mankind, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a Man from under the power of Satan into the Kingdom of his Son, without reſpect had to previous workings to harbinger and make the way ready for it; yet ordinarily 'tis

The progreſſes of Grace imitate the methods of Nature, bring the deſigned effects to paſs by degrees, and do not paſs from one extreme to another, without the mediation. of ſome preparatory Diſpoſitions. Not that theſe initial preparatory Diſpoſitions do efficiently cooperate with Gods Spirit to the production of habitual, ſanctifying, and ſaving Grace, as temperate Endeavours produce in Morality an habitual Temperance, or Natural Qualities diſpoſe to Natural Forms, by a natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Connection, or as if by a ſupervening adjutorial power of Gods Spirit, moral Vertues and common Graces did loſe their ſpecifick Forms, and were materially wrought up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an higher Species, and transformed into Spiritual and ſpecial Graces: but theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things through the ordination and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, and by a moral connection, are bleſſed and crowned with Perfection, and are ordinarily conditions preſuppoſed in us to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

And I am ſure of this, if acts of moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and common Graces do not Pleaſe God as acts of ſpecial and ſanctifying Graces do, yet they do not Provoke him as acts of habituate Vices do; and the further we are from Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, the nearer we are to Pleaſe him.</p>

And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably in this diſtribution of Favours and Rewards he proceeds by a Geometrical and not by an Arithmetical proportion: he which by his diligence improved two Talents to four, found as favourable an acceptance as he which improved five to ten: there was the ſame Conſideration and as much Reaſon, that he which had improved two Talents ſhould be commended and rewarded, as there was that the other ſhould, who had impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved five; for, all things conſidered, the one had done as much as the other.</p>

Although the Will of God be ſimply or entirely free, reſpectively to all external adminiſtrations towards his Creatures, yet upon the ſuppoſition of one free Act towards them, he may be neceſſitated to another.</hi> Thus, God having commanded Sinners to purſue the Salvation of their Souls by endeavouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from Sin, and engaging themſelves in the ſervice of the Goſpel, and walking worthy of him, unto all well-pleaſing, he hath oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

So, many pretend they are willing to be converted or cleanſed from the leproſy of Sin, but 'tis upon their own terms; if God by his omnipotent Impulſe will over-power and irreſiſtibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Wills to chuſe the better part, they muſt ſubmit; for who <hi>hath</hi> or can, <hi>reſiſt his Will?</hi> but for their parts they will be at no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of Study, Care, or Pains for it: God and his ſubordinate Inſtruments muſt do it without them, if he will have it done. <hi>It is not</hi> (ſay they from the Apoſtle) <hi>of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Rom. 9.16.
